What are RPCs?
	RPCs, or Remote Procedure Calls, are a fundamental concept in networked game development, especially in Unity when working with Network GameObjects. 
	In the context of Unity's networking system, an RPC allows a client or server to execute a method on a remote machine across the network. 
	In other words, RPCs in Unity allow methods to be executed across the network, synchronizing game actions and states between different players' devices.
